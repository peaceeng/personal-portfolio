Hi there ‚úåÔ∏è nice to meet you! I'm a _Senior Fullstack Engineer_.

I'm an aspiring Senior Fullstack Engineer with a passion for writing code and making things on the web look pretty. I'm well acquainted with various _UX design_ & _research methods_ as well as _frontend_, _backend_, _database_ and _cloud technologies_. Therefore, I strive to create simple, functional and impactful user experiences. I primarily code in **Typescript** and use **Node.js**, **Python** and **Java** for backend.

In my free time, I love to play football, watch football ‚öΩ, cook, play the piano, explore neighborhoods through food and occasionally bring out my inner photographer. Also, did someone say sushi? üç£
