Hi there ‚úåÔ∏è nice to meet you! I'm a _Senior Fullstack Engineer_.

I'm an aspiring Software Engineer with a passion for writing code and making things on the web look pretty. I'm well acquainted with various _UX design_ & _research methods_ as well as _frontend_, _backend_, _database_ and _cloud technologies_. I have always been a firm believer in the human element of design and knowing your audience. Therefore, I strive to create simple, functional and impactful user experiences. I primarily code in **Python** and **Typescript**, and use **Adobe XD** and **Illustrator** for designing.

In my free time, I love to play volleyball, watch football ‚öΩ, cook, play the guitar, explore neighborhoods through food and occasionally bring out my inner photographer. Also, did someone say sushi? üç£
