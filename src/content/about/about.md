Hi there ‚úåÔ∏è nice to meet you! I'm a _Senior Fullstack Engineer_.

With over 8 years in software development, I specialize as a _Full Stack Engineer_, _Cloud Engineer_ and _Solutions Architect_ with expertise in **React**, **Node.js**, **TypeScript** and **AWS**. I have significantly contributed to the launch of 30+ large-scale web applications, focusing on improving seamless user experiences by 25%. Adept at collaborating in Agile environments, I consistently deliver high-quality products on schedule. My diverse technical skills and commitment drive project success.

In my free time, I love to play football, watch football ‚öΩ, cook, play the piano, explore neighborhoods through food and occasionally bring out my inner photographer. Also, did someone say sushi? üç£
